# Reddit_Translation_Bot

This is a Reddit bot I created to do language translation using the Googletrans library, an unofficial library that uses the API
of translate.google.com. It is a little simpler to use than the official Google Translate API. The bot has a character limit of 15k, 
which is perfect for Reddit comments and submissions. I have removed the client_id, client_secret, username, and password from this 
script as this is the page being used as the documentation for the production bot. 

This bot is not currently running on a server. I will be sporadically running it to do testing. Ideally I want this bot to be running
continuously for anyone to use on Reddit. This documentation will be updated at that time.
